# Call management

Call management enables organisations to manage resource allocation through a structured application and review process. This feature is particularly useful for research institutions, funding agencies, and organisations that need to allocate computational or infrastructure resources through a competitive process.

## Introduction

The call management module is built around structured components: calls, rounds, proposals, and reviews. A call is a defined period during which resources can be allocated. Each call is divided into rounds, where stakeholders can submit and review proposals for resource allocation. Proposals are evaluated through a structured review process. Successful proposals result in approved allocations that seamlessly integrate with the rest of the platform. When a proposal is approved, a project will be automatically created under the proposing organisation that initiated the call. Allocations are granted to this project, and team members who submitted the proposal are added to the project, ensuring the resources are immediately ready for use.
