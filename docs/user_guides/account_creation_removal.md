# Account Creation and Removal

## Account Creation

To establish an account on Puhuri Portal, the Resource Allocator or Principal Investigator (PI) must extend an invitation to the project or organization.
Upon receiving the invitation, users can log in and initiate the creation of their MyAccessID account following [this user guideline](https://puhuri.neic.no/user_guides/myaccessid_registration), providing the necessary information.
Subsequently, upon completing this process, users will find themselves seamlessly integrated into Puhuri Portal. Following acceptance of the terms and conditions of Puhuri Portal, the account in Puhuri Portal is automatically synchronized with MyAccessID (and with LUMI cluster if LUMI user).

## Account Removal

### Remove the account from Puhuri Portal

!!! note
       It’s important to note that while this process removes your account in Puhuri Portal, it does not impact your MyAccessID account.

To request the removal of your MyAccessID account, a separate email should be directed to the MyAccessID support team at this address: [support+myaccessid@eduteams.org](mailto:support+myaccessid@eduteams.org).

This two-step process ensures a comprehensive account removal procedure while maintaining the integrity of your associated accounts.
