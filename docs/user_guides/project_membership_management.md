# Project membership management

Project team contains users with different roles:

- Principal Investigator (PI)  - An individual recognized by the prime institution who is responsible for the scientific and administrative leadership of the project.
- Co-Principal Investigator (co-PI) is a collaborator who shares leadership and responsibility for a research project with the primary Principal Investigator (PI).
- Member is a user who works on one or more phases of the project and is involved in executing assigned tasks.
- Guest is a user who is only able to see the project-related data but cannot modify it.
  
Please see [this page](https://puhuri.neic.no/user_guides/user_roles/) for User Rights based on Roles in the Organization.

## If Userâ€™s Home Organization changes

- <b>Informing Changes:</b>

If a user changes their organization, it is their responsibility to notify the Principal Investigator (PI).
If the PI's organization changes, they should inform the Resource Allocation Body (RA), as specified in the service provider's terms of use.

- <b>Evaluation and Approval:</b>

The PI and/or RA will assess whether continued usage is allowed.

- <b>Account Transition:</b>

Users must register a new account due to identity provider changes.
The new user account needs to be added to the project by the PI or co-PI.

- <b>Data Migration:</b>

Before closing the old account, users should migrate files to the home organization.
Data can be copied back when the new account is opened.

- <b>Usage Restrictions:</b>

If LUMI usage is disallowed, the PI or RA should remove the user from the project team.
