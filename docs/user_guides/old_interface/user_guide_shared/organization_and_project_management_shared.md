## Requesting an allocation

To get an allocation via Puhuri Portal, project participants must first request it.
Request can be initiated by any user, however it must be approved:

 - by PI before being sent to Resource Allocator.
 - by Resource Allocator before being sent to Puhuri Core for processing by the service.

Below is an example of requesting an allocation from LUMI supercomputer:

1. Select "Service catalog" from the sidebar menu and select offering that matches your plans.
   For LUMI, offerings correspond to access types of EuroHPC:
    - Extreme Scale Access
    - Regular Access
    - Benchmark Access
    - Development Access
    - Fast Track Access for Academia
    - Fast Track Access for Industry

5. Click on the "Add to cart".

6. Check once more and click on "Request an approval" if you not a PI in a project or "Request" if you PI.
