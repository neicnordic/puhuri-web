## Introduction

Puhuri aims to facilitate easy and efficient access to high-performance computing (HPC) and related services throughout Europe to benefit researchers and industrial users. The key objective is to minimise service providers' administrative costs while simultaneously improving these services' usability. This will be achieved by establishing federated services for Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI) and resource allocation services.
