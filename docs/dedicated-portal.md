# Dedicated Portal

A dedicated portal is a web-based platform (Waldur instance) that is designed and developed specifically for a particular organisation, group, or community. 

The portal can be customised (including custom URL, email, service desk, terms of service and privacy policy documents) to meet the specific needs of the organisation, with branding, content, and access controls tailored to the organisation's requirements. These portals can also include features that are not available in the shared portal. It can be compared to the national allocation portals. Dedicated portals can also be hosted at the owning organisation's data centre.
