# Requirements for IdPs integrated directly

*If the IdP is connected to one of the R&E Federations but is not published in eduGAIN, then please advise the IdP operator to request their IdP to be published to the eduGAIN metadata.*

IdPs that are not connected to an R&E federation, need to be in one of the eligible categories in order to be integrated on MyAccessID:

- Recognised community platforms that require access to resources using MyAccessID;
- High Performance Computing facilities which operate their Identity Management Systems.

If the IdP you wish to integrate is not connected to an R&E Federation and does not fit in any of the above categories, please contact us.

## Supported Protocols

The IdP MUST support one of the following protocols:

- OIDC
- SAML2

## Attribute release requirements

IdPs must release the following attributes for users to successfully complete registration and use MyAccessID and consequently PUHURI:

- **Email** 
- **Name**, that can be sent as :
  - **Common Name** or 
  - **Display Name** or
  - **Given Name** and **Family Name**
- **Identifier**, that can be sent as: 
  - **subject-id** or
  - **pairwise-id** or
  - **persistent name-id** or

IdPs are required to release also the following attributes for users to successfully use services connected to PUHURI:

- **Affiliation**
- **Home Organization**
- **Assurance**  - attribute will become mandatory
- **Community Identifier**

Please refer to [Attribute formats](https://puhuri.neic.no/idp_integration/attributes) for specification of accepted attribute formats.

## Level of Assurance requirements

Access to services connected to PUHURI is allowed only with use of identities that fulfil certain identity assurance criteria. To express the required assurance levels, the [REFEDS Assurance suite](https://wiki.refeds.org/display/ASS) is used. 

Requirements are defined for two aspects of identity assurance: 

- Identifier uniqueness to ensure unambiguous identification of users
- Identity proofing and credential issuance, renewal, and replacement to ensure that identity trustworthy represents right natural person 

Level of assurance for an identity issued to a user is expressed at the time of user authentication by the IdP sending eduPersonAssurance attribute with following values:

- https://refeds.org/assurance/ID/UNIQUE; or https://refeds.org/assurance/ID/eppn-unique-no-reassign, and
- https://refeds.org/assurance/IAP/medium or https://refeds.org/assurance/IAP/high
