# Shared Puhuri Portal

Shared Puhuri Portal is meant for resource allocators, who are not able to host allocation portal themselves or do not have a national allocation portal for resource management.

Shared portal provides less customized version (like fixed access url, own privacy policy etc not included) compared to the Puhuri dedicated portal to fit the needs of several resource allocators.
